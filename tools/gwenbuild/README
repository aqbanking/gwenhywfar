GwenBuild
=========

GwenBuild is yet another build system.

"autotools" (automake, autoconf) are really cool and they work in almost every case as expected.
However, they are extremely slow which is a problem with larger projects containing many source files
and convenience libraries. Also, they are hard to debug if you encounter unusual problems, e.g. in AqBanking
we have the problem that sometimes not all sources/convenience libraries are correctly rebuilt after source code
changes and up to now I have no idea why that is.

A nice solution would be to switch to "cmake", especially when using their build target "ninja" which is
astonishingly fast. "cmake" is quite easy to setup for simple projects, however, it is not that easy to change larger projects 
to use it. Also, there is quite a steep learning curve.

"meson" is another good alternative since it also uses "ninja" and is therefore also extremely fast. But I wasn't able to
adapt my projects to use "meson" because some features I needed for e.g. AqFinance or AqBanking required a version of "meson" newer 
than what is provided by the distribution I'm currently working with.

Out of curiosity "gwenbuild" was started. I wanted to see how fast a build system can be and how hard it would be to write one.
Gwenbuild is a tool inside the library gwenhywfar, which is a base library for all my projects. Therefore it is always available in 
the required version for depending projects. Gwenhywfar itself will not be ported to use this build system to avoid the 
hen-and-egg-problem.


The following major goals were identified before development started:
- needs to be much faster than autotools/make
- needs to provide library, header and function search functions
- needs to be able to generate a "config.h" file
- needs to be able to rewrite files by replacing placeholders in source files (like "sed" does in ./configure)
- needs to be simple to setup
- needs to have support for typemaker2 source files
- needs to allow out-of-source build
- should be easy to extend
- should handle dependency trees



QuickStart for Users
--------------------

- create a new folder in which to build, there:
- "gwbuild PATH_TO_SOURCE_FOLDER"
- "gwbuild -p"
- "gwbuild -B tm2builder" (sometimes needed explicitly)
- "gwbuild -jMAX_NUMBER_OF_PARALLEL_JOBS"

After changing source files only the last step needs to be repeated.



QuickStart for Development
--------------------------

- builder (modules which generate commands to compile or link source files) are defined in XML files in "builders/" (see *.gwb files).
- new builders should be added in file "gwenbuild.c" in functions "_genBuilderForSourceFile()" and "_genBuilderForTarget()" at
  the bottom of that file.



Current Status
--------------

gwenbuild is now able to compile C and C++ files, link shared libraries and temporary convenience libraries and generate source files
from typemaker2 type description files. It also handles dependencies and custom build commands (like for XML merge) can now be defined
which can also use gwenbuild's dependency handling.

It can build using multiple processes in parallel. Compiling and linking AqBanking using 14 processes in parallel takes about 9 secs on 
my machine now.



How it Works Internally
------------------------

The first step is to setup the build environment. The user changes into an empty folder outside the source tree
(or in a folder inside it like "build") and runs "gwbuild SRCFOLDER". In this run gwenbuild reads the 0BUILD files in the
top source folder and all other 0BUILD files referred to inside the 0BUILD file(s) and collects all the info about targets and object
files etc.
From this run a "BuildContext" is generated. This structure contains a list of commands needed to compile and link the files of the
project. This structure has no further knowledge of the generated project other than which files to compile/link and how the files
of the project depend on each other.
This build context is then used in the subsequent steps of the gwenbuild process like in "gwbuild -p" (prepare) and
"gwbuild -b" (build).
The last step usually is to install the generated files using "gwbuild -i". This step only reads a file containing the list
of files to install and copies the files from the given list to their specified destinations. This step also has no knowledge
of the project to build, it simply works on the install file list.



Some notes to myself
====================

Build dependecies:
   cc -E -I INCLUDE_FOLDER -M -MF DEPOUTFILE SRCFILE

or 
   $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -MM *.c > Makefile.deps
   

# shared lib:
gcc -shared -nostdlib -o libaqdiagram.so aqdiagram.o -lgwenhywfar -lgmp -Wl,--whole-archive draw/libaqdg_draw.a




TODO:
- eventuell Builder_AddCmds und <BuildFiles> angleichen (verwenden von GWEN_DB wie bei <BuildFiles>)
  -> commandsFromXml()

- DIST implementieren (tarball bauen)
- shared vs. static
- writeFile: Ergebnis Datei nicht als DIST, sondern dessen Quelle!
- commands
  - cppcheck
  

-s           setup build environment
-p           run preparation commands (needed e.g. if typemaker2 is used)
-b           build targets
-i           install files
-c           cleanup; delete generated files
-r           repeat setup command using the same arguments given to last setup
-Oname=value specify options (can occur multiple times)
-Bname       Only run commands for the given build (mostly used with 'tm2builder')
-Lname       Set loglevel (debug, info, notice, warn, error)
-Cname       Crosscompile for given environment (e-g- 'x86_64-w64-mingw32')
-jvalue      Use the given number of parallel process for building
